    <h1>what is this?</h1>
    My work is influenced by Musical Chord Progression Arpeggiator 
     <a href="https://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/pen/qNrZywM">This is a link</a> <br>
    I think it is good walk, but i wanted to make it better.<br>
    First thing I have done is adding drum machine using Tone.js.<br>
    As arpeggio is good for Accompaniment, I think that Drum machine+arpeggiator is very good combination.<br>
    Second one is synth controller pannel. with using 2 envelope, we can change our synth's tone.<br>
    Third one is make chord sellector. in my opinion using only diatonic chord is not enough for making music.<br>
    and also, using all the possible chords like tension chord, sus4 chord, augment chord... is not a good idea<br>
    because it makes our web too much complicated. so i only made fundamental chords with 4notes.<br>
    Fourth one is making arpeggio pattern. my example's case make all the possibilities and select among them.<br> 
    but i thought that something like drum machine is much easy. so i made it with multislider which is easy to control<br>
    In final i wanted to make something fun. so i made random! button for beat maker and arpeggio pattern maker<br>
    and in drum machine i made a line that plays chord which makes very rythmical sound.

    <h1>how to use?</h1>
    my work is made of 5 parts.<br>
    first part is on left on screen. in there we can control volume of synth and stop/start my work and radiobutton above can on/off other parts.
    second part is drum machine. it is very common drummanchine except bottom line. i made a polysynth that play chords and it makes good sound.<br>
    third part is synth controller. we can control 2 envelope for monosynth that plays arpeggio notes.<br>
    foruth part is chord selector. With radiobutton, we can change which bar's chord to change and after select <br>which bar to change, we can select chord by seletor and 2 button easily. before change, you can hear canon chord progression in c key.<br>
    last part is for arpeggio pattern. we can adjust slides to make good pattern.<br> zero in slider means no sound and others play correnpond note in chord selected before.
